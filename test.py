Note that the string assignment of x includes a \. This is a way to concatenate two strings, so it works the same as +. Python convention has a maximum length each line can be, and so do the boxes on this page! This is a way to format a string so it can be (nicely indented to line up visually) on two lines. Weâ€™ll get into other examples later.

# To avoid confusion with capitals and lower case letters, only use lower case letters in variable names. In Python this adheres to the style guidelines.
# If a variable name is chosen that consists of multiple words, put one underscore between each of the words.
# Never choose variable names that start with an underscore. Such variable names are considered reserved for the authors of the Python interpreter.

# It is conventional to always put one space after a # comment, and add two in front if itâ€™s on the same line as code. For example:

# this bit calculates an average
avg = (10 + 5 + 10 + 5) / 4
print("The average is:", avg)  # show the user

ðŸ¤– **Data Science example**: larger projects with multiple people working on them might have fancy ways of distributing tasks (such as [Slack](https://slack.com), [kanban boards](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards), etc.). A rudimentary way of doing this for yourself is through the use of special comment formats such as

`# TODO: this thing`, `# NOTE: don't break this!`, `# BUG: uh oh it broke`, `#FIXME: please unbreak`. VSCode has extensions (apps) that list these
