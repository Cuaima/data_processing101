Question 2

A social media influencer wants to increase their followers. They noticed that every time they post a give-away, followers increase by 10%. Naively assuming this goes on forever, theyâ€™d like to know how many give-aways to post in order to reach a particular target number of followers.

Parameters: Write a function get_followers which as input takes two arguments:
n_followers : a non-negative int, representing the current number of followers.
t_followers : a non-negative int, representing the target number of followers.

Return: a non-negative int representing the number of give-aways that ensures reaching the target number of followers (assuming the current number of followers as a start).

Example: so,
get_followers(100000,200000)

should return:
8
